# CLUSTER UPGRAGE PROCESS 
* When upgrading a clister, you upgrade the master node first before you upgrade the worker node. 

* Worker node does not get affected when the master node is upgrading. 

## Strategies in upgrading the work nodes 


# Backup and Restore Methods
1. Delecarative approach 

* IN this approach we use configuration yaml files 
* Store the yaml files in the source code repository. 

2. Query Kube-api server 
* 
3. Backup ETCD 
* It stores information about the state of a cluster
* A snapshot of the ETCD cluster can be taken and can be backed up. 
* etcdctl is a command line client for the ETCD. 
* To make use of etcdctl for tasks such as back up and restore, make sure that you set the ETCDCTL_API to 3.

## Take a snapshot of the ETCD database using the built-in snapshot functionality. Store the backup file at location /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
