# Monolithic Architecture

* The entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. 
* All processes in the app are tightly coupled and run as a single service
* This means any changes to one part of the application can have an impact on other parts. 
* Monolithic applications are easier to develop and deploy since there is only one codebase to manage.
* However, they can be more difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows in complexity.


# Microservices Architecture
* Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development
* The software is composed of small independent services 
* All the small independent services communicate each other through APIs.
* Each service is designed to perform a specific function, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 
* Microservices architectures are highly scalable and flexible, and can be easier to maintain as the application grows in complexity. 
* However, they can also be more complex to develop and deploy since there are multiple codebases to manage.
