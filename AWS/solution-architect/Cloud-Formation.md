# CLOUD FORMATION 

*  CloudFormation is an infrastructure automation platform for AWS
*  Cloud Formation provides users with a simple way to create and manage a collection of AWS resources by provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable way. 
*  Deploys AWS resources in a repeatable, testable and auditable manner.
*  Provides and manages stack of AWS resources based on the template created. 
*  AWS CloudFormation  uses template files to automate the setup of AWS resources.
* Aws Cloud formation helps to mamange the complete infracture or AWS resources in a text file. (JSON/YAML)

## NOTE:

* Template File: This is the file of all the AWS resources that needs to be created (JASON/YAML)
  
* Stack: A collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit.
  
* ChangeSet: Change sets allow you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources

Change Sets are created by building a new CloudFormation Template (or modifying the original) and creating a change on the original stack. You can then view the changes that will be deployed before you decide to execute the change.
