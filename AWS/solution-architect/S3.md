# Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3)
* S3 is an object storage service.
* It offers: Scalability
* S3 is a key value store
Key -Name of the file(object)
Value - The content of the file(object)
* S3 has an indefinate storage (It expands storage according to your need)

## Amazon S3 Buckets 
* S3 allows to store objects(files) in buckets(directories).
* All bucket must has global unique name (Nobody can use the same bukect name twice)
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* When creating a buckets:
    * Buckets name cannot be empty
    * NO uppercase and underscore
    * Must only have lowercase or numbers
    * Min of 3 characters
    * Max of 63 charachers
    * Not looks like an IP address  
* Even though S3 is a global view, we have to specify a specific region when creatiing a buckets 

## Amazon S3 -- Objects 
* Objects (files) have a key 
* All objects has a max size of 5TB storage space.
* If object size more than 5TB, AWS will use multi-part upload.

## Amazon S3 use cases 
1. Backup and storaeg 
2. Disaster recovery 
3. Archive 
4. Hybrid cloud storage 
5. Application hosting 
6. media hosting 
7. Static website 
8. Software deliver 


## METADATA
* Metadata is a set of name-value pairs.Types are: 
    * System-Defined Objets Metadata: Automatic Created by AWS 
    * User-Defined Objects Metadata: Name always start with [x-amz-meta]
Note: Every resources created ia own by the root user 

## Aamzon S3 Security 
1. User-Based 
  * Authorize with API called for a specific IAM user.
2. Resource BASED 
   *  Buket policiies - Bucket rules assigned from th S3 consiles , allows cross account (CAN BE DIABLED)
   *  Object Access Control Lists (ACL)  (CAN BE DIABLED) 
   *  
NOTES: An IAM pricipal can acess an s3 onject if
1. the user has an IAM permission to allows it 
2. The ressource policy allow it 

## S3 Bucket policies
1. JSON Based polies 
   * Resources are buckets and object 
   * Acion: Set APIO to allow or deny 
   * Pricipal : The account OR  user to apply the policy

FOR EXAMPLE: 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::temi1997/*"
        }
    ]
}


2. S3 Bucket policy 
   * Give piblic access to the bucket 
   * Force object to be encrypted at upload 
   * Cross account (grant access to another account)
# Amazon S3 Versioning 
* Versioning means keeping mutiple variant of an object in the same bucket. 
* When you enable versioning on a bucket, you can easily recover from unintended user actions (e.g deletion or overwrite)
* When you overwrite an objects, it will create version ID for the objects.
* Versioning is done at the bucket level.
* Buckets ststes
    * Unversioned- Not version 
    * Versioning- enabled
    * Versioning suspended- Does not delete the previous versions. 
*Note 
* Once versioning is enabled on a bucket, it cannot be disabled
* Versioning uses more space. 
* The first version of every objects, the version id is NULL
* Any version that is not versioned proir to enabling versioning  will have version "full" 
*  

# Amazon S3 Server Access Logging
* Server access logging provides detailed records of anything done in an S3 bucket
* S3 server access login is enabled at the bucket level.
* It used for security and access audit purposes.
* When S3 server accces login is enebaled,  every request made to the s3 bucket from any account will be logged into another S3 bucket. 
* This means that we need to create a specific bucket for server access logging 
    Notes: - It better to anable versioning in this new bucket.
           - Also enable MFA DELETE becuae it asks for MFA before anayone can delete anaything in this bucket. 
* Both authorized and unauthorized attempt will be loggen when S3 server access is enabeled.

## Amazon S3 Storage Classes/Tiers
Ama
each object in Amazon s3 has diff sro
 # 

# CREATE BUCKET IN AWS CLI 
* Create Bucket
 aws s3 mb s3://temi1997/

* Put File in s3 Bucket
$ aws s3 cp Devops/index.html s3://temi1997/

* Bucket Policys
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",

        }
    ]
}

## Amazon s3  - Static websiste
* S3 can host a website abd have them sccesible on the internet. 

## Amazon S3 Replication 
* Only new objects are replicated 
* Use S3 Batch Replication to replict existing objects

## Deletion Operation
* Can replicate delete marker from source to target (Optional setting)
* Deletion with a version ID are not replicatd 
* Replication on worls when verisoning is enabled 

## Amazon S3 has a very high durability 
## Amazon availability depends on the storge classes 

## Amazon S3 Storage Classes 
1. S3 Standard 
   *Used when yiu wnat more than 3 replication or copies
   * Highly avaliable 
   * Highly durable Costly 
   * Easily retrieved 
   * Used for frequently access data 

2. S3 IA (Infrequent access) 
   * Used for more than 3  replica
   * Highly durable 
   * Highly avaliable 
   * fast retrieval 
   * Less costly to standard 
   * Minimum size on file (128) 
   * Objects shoule be at least 30 days in standard   to move to IA 
   * Infrequent access
   
3. S3 One ZONE IA 
   * No replucation 
   * Less durable 
   * less avaliable 
   * lower cost Less critical data 
   * Data should be theer 30 days in stanndard 
   * Stored in a single AZ 
   * 
  
4. S3 Intelligent Tiering 
   * Automatically moves data/object to diffrent classes based on the usage,  so as to optimiize the cost 
   * No retrival time 
   * It automatically moves objects between different access tiers 
    1. Frequent access tier: Designed for objects that are accessed frequently.
    2. Infrequent access â€“ Designed for objects that are accessed less frequently.
    3. Archive Instant Access tier: Low cost storage tier optimized for rarely needed objects 
    4. Deep Archive Access Tier: Dessigned for objects that are accesss at a maximum of once or twice a year. 

5. S3 Glacier
   * Its a low cost storage class
   * Used for data archiviin g
   * But retrieving the data takes from minutes to hours 
   * Used when a data is inftrequently accessed
  
6. S3 Glacieir Deep Archiive 
   * Cheapest deeep archival storage class
   * Reteivel time takes 12 hours 
   * infrequently access 

## Lifecylces rules 
1. Transition Actions : Configure object to transition to another storage class 
   
2. Expiration Actions : Configure object to expire (delete) after some time 

## S3 Requestor Pays 
1. Disable Requester pays - Buket owna will pay for all the Amazon S3 storage and data tranfer cost or networking cost  associated with thier bucket. 
2. Enable Requester pays - Requesters will pay the networking cost for every object that is downloaded 
Note: Requeste must not be anonymous in AWS 

## S3 Event Notification 
* What are the events 
   S3:Objectcreatetd 
   S3:Objectremopved etc

* Even notification can be sent to diff nnotifications like (SNS, SQS, Lambda functions)

* FOR EVENT NOFICATION TO WORK WE NEED IAM PERMISSIONS
  1. For SNS --- Attach SNS Resource (Access) policy 
  2. SQS ---- Attach SQS Resource (Access) policy
  3. Lambda Funstions ---- Attach Lambda Resource policy 

* All the event are sent to the Amazon Event bridge 

## S3 Select & Glacier Select 
* S3 select increase query performance and reduced cost 
* It retrieves the specific data nbeeded for the application using SQL by performing server-side filtering 
* It help to reduce network transfer , CPU cost 

##  S3 BATCH OPERATIONS 
  1. Perfoms bulk operation on existing S3 objects with a single request 
        * Modify object metadata 
        * copy object between S3 buckets 
        * Restore objects 
        * Encrypt un ecrypted object
